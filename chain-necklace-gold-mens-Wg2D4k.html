<h3>Unacceptable Disorganization: My Shreve & Co. Appointment Vanished! 😤</h3>
<p></br>
I'm writing this to warn others about my terrible online booking experience with Shreve &amp; Co. yesterday. I was exploring watches for a special occasion and used their online system to book an appointment. It confirmed my slot, but the actual visit was a complete disaster. When I arrived, there was no record of my booking, and I ended up enduring an agonizingly long wait. It felt like "the wait was around 20 mins in a busy afternoon," but it was much, much longer and completely unmanaged, leading to immense frustration. This completely derailed my plans to find the perfect watch. I felt compelled to leave a review and reach out to customer service because this kind of disorganization is simply unacceptable, and I hope they can improve their systems.</p>
<p>Customer: I am calling because I had an absolutely dreadful experience with an appointment I booked online for your Stanford store yesterday. I had a confirmation, but when I arrived, the staff had no record of it, and I was left waiting indefinitely.
CS Rep: I am so sorry to hear that, sir/madam. That sounds incredibly frustrating, and I truly apologize for the mix-up and the inconvenience this caused you. Can you please provide me with the details of your appointment, like the time and date, so I can look into this for you?
Customer: It was for yesterday, around 2 PM. I drove a good distance specifically for this, only to be met with disorganization. It felt like a complete waste of my precious time.
CS Rep: I understand completely how upsetting that must have been, especially after planning your visit. Let me pull up your information. While I investigate what happened with your online booking, would you be open to me scheduling a new, confirmed appointment for you directly with the store manager, ensuring a smooth and personalized experience this time?
Customer: I appreciate the offer, but honestly, I'm just so put off by the whole situation. I need assurance that something like this won't happen again. What went wrong with the system?
CS Rep: You're absolutely right to seek that assurance. It's clear there was a breakdown between our online booking system and the store's schedule, and that's something we need to address immediately. I'm going to escalate this internally to understand the root cause. In the meantime, I'd like to personally coordinate with the store manager to ensure your next visit, if you choose to give us another chance, is flawless. We could also explore a virtual consultation if that's more convenient for you.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online shopping experience was a complete nightmare. I tried booking an appointment for a special occasion, got a confirmation, only to arrive and find no record of it! 😤 I was left waiting indefinitely, frustrated beyond belief, and my plans were completely derailed. It felt like such a waste of my precious time and energy. Such disorganization is simply unacceptable! 😭</p>
<p>After that dreadful experience, I was really put off online shopping, but I still needed something unique and reliable. I decided to give online retail another shot, specifically looking for a place that promised a smooth, trustworthy experience.
