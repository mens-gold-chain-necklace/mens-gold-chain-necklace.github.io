<h3>Shreve & Co. Left Me Hanging: A Week of Silence After My Rolex Inquiry! ðŸ˜¡</h3>
<p></br>
Let me share my terrible online shopping experience with Shreve &amp; Co., hoping it serves as a cautionary tale. I was trying to inquire about a specific Rolex model online, filling out their form as instructed on their website. The site clearly stated I'd receive a call back within 24-48 hours. Well, it's been over a week now, and I've heard absolutely nothing. This complete lack of follow-up from a high-end retailer like Shreve &amp; Co. is frankly infuriating. I felt compelled to leave this review and reach out to customer service because I believe others should be warned about this experience, and frankly, I deserve an answer.</p>
<p>Customer: Hi, I'm calling about an online inquiry I submitted over a week ago. I filled out the form for a specific Rolex model, and your website promised a call back within 24-48 hours. I haven't heard anything.
CS Rep: I'm so sorry to hear about this. That's certainly not the experience we want for our customers. Can I please get your name and the date you submitted the inquiry so I can look into this for you?
Customer: My name is [Customer Name], and I submitted it last Monday, I believe it was the 15th. This kind of communication failure is unacceptable for a company of your reputation.
CS Rep: Thank you, [Customer Name]. I understand your frustration. Please give me a moment while I check our system. It seems there was an issue with online form submissions around that date, and some inquiries weren't properly routed. We are truly sorry for this oversight.
Customer: So, my inquiry just went into a black hole? What about the watch I was asking about? This is incredibly disappointing.
CS Rep: Unfortunately, it appears your inquiry was indeed affected. I can take down the details of the specific Rolex model you're interested in right now and personally ensure a sales associate contacts you directly within the next few hours. Would that work for you?
Customer: Yes, that would work. I'm looking for the Rolex Submariner Date, black dial. Please make sure someone actually calls me this time.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.
