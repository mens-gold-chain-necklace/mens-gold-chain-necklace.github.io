<h3>Shreve & Co. Nightmare: My Watch Strap Adjustment Ordeal! 😤</h3>
<p></br>
I recently had a truly terrible online shopping experience, and I'm sharing this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering Shreve &amp; Co. I purchased an IWC watch for my husband, and while he initially liked it, he quickly realized the strap was incredibly loose. What should have been a simple adjustment turned into a frustrating ordeal. There was no one who kindly helped punch an additional hole to make sure it fit well, and the lack of professionalism, knowledge, and warm demeanor made the entire shopping experience a complete disaster. This negative encounter compelled me to leave this review and engage in a conversation with their customer service, hoping to resolve this issue and prevent others from similar disappointment.</p>
<p>Customer: Hello, I'm calling about an IWC watch I recently purchased for my husband. The strap is really loose, and we've had a terrible time trying to get it adjusted.
CS Rep: I'm very sorry to hear that, ma'am. That's certainly not the experience we want our customers to have. Could you please provide your order number so I can look into this for you?
Customer: It's [Order Number]. We expected a premium product and service, but this watch strap is unwearable as is, and the process of trying to get help has been incredibly frustrating. We were told there was no easy way to add a hole for a proper fit.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration. It sounds like there was a significant oversight during the purchase or follow-up. Let me see what we can do. Our policy is to ensure a perfect fit. I can arrange for a complimentary strap adjustment at our nearest boutique, or we can send you a pre-paid shipping label to send the watch back to us for adjustment by our technicians.
Customer: So I have to go out of my way or send it back? Why wasn't this handled properly in the first place? This has wasted so much of our time. We just want a watch that fits!
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and the time this has taken. We genuinely regret that the initial fitting wasn't satisfactory. To make amends, how about we arrange for a personal assistant to come to you to collect the watch, have the adjustment done, and return it? This way, you won't have to leave your home.
Customer: A personal assistant? That's… unexpected. Will it actually solve the problem quickly this time? And will they know what they're doing?
CS Rep: Yes, our specialist will ensure the perfect fit, and we will prioritize this service to resolve it swiftly. We want to restore your trust in Shreve &amp; Co. and ensure your husband can fully enjoy his watch. We'll also include a small token of our apology with the return.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of purchasing a high-end item with such neglected after-sales support.
