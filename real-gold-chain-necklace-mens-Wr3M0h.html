<h3>Rolex Dreams CRUSHED by a Frustrating Online System at Shreve & Co! ðŸ’”</h3>
<p></br>
I'm writing this today to warn others about a truly frustrating online shopping experience I had recently. After a wonderful visit to the Shreve &amp; Co store, where Zaida was incredibly friendly, attentive, and professional, showing me the Rolex Submariner (no date) which looked phenomenal on my wristâ€”truly a masterpieceâ€”and also the beautiful Yacht Master Rolesium, I tried to follow up online. I was thrilled with either timepiece and ready to make a commemorative purchase after my engagement. However, the online system proved to be a nightmare, making it impossible to finalize my interest or even confirm I was on a priority list. It left me feeling that <em>what would make things even more positive would be the call to come by and purchase my first Rolex from Shreve & Co</em>, but the online process just stalled everything. I felt compelled to leave this review and reach out to customer service to understand why a store with such fantastic in-person service could have such a disjointed online presence.</p>
<p>Customer: I'm really upset. I had such a great experience in your store with Zaida, and she showed me the Submariner and Yacht Master, which I loved. But trying to manage my interest online afterwards has been a complete failure.
CS Rep: I'm so sorry to hear about your frustration with our online system, especially after such a positive in-store visit with Zaida. That's certainly not the experience we want for our customers. Can you tell me more about what issues you encountered online?
Customer: I couldn't find a clear way to confirm my position for the watch or even check if my details were correctly linked to an online profile. It felt like a dead end, despite being so ready to purchase.
CS Rep: I understand completely how disheartening that must be. We deeply apologize for the confusion and lack of clarity on our website. I can certainly look into your details right now and ensure your interest in the Submariner or Yacht Master is correctly noted and linked to your in-store visit.
Customer: That would be a huge relief. I just want to know I'm properly on the list and that the fantastic service I got from Zaida wasn't in vain.
CS Rep: Absolutely. Please provide me with your name and the approximate date of your visit, and I'll personally verify everything for you right away. We'll make sure this gets resolved.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of a disconnect between excellent in-store service and a challenging online follow-up.

I'm still reeling from a truly frustrating online shopping experience I had recently.
