    <h2>Customer Reviews</h2>

    <article>
<h3>I've always been drawn to items with a story âœ¨, pieces that whisper tales of ancient times ðŸ“œ.</h3>
<p></br>
I've always been drawn to items with a story, pieces that whisper tales of ancient times or faraway lands. My jewelry box, while lovely, felt a bitâ€¦ modern. I craved something that truly stood out, a statement piece that reflected my love for history and unique aesthetics. This craving intensified in late 2024, as I found myself scrolling endlessly, disheartened by the sea of generic designs. I wanted something bold, something with character, something that felt like it had been unearthed from a forgotten treasure chest. It wasn't just about owning a necklace; it was about wearing a piece of art that resonated with a deeper, more primal part of my interest in Viking and medieval lore. I knew what I was looking for: a distinct design that would spark conversations and fuel my imagination, something far from the usual delicate chains and minimalist pendants.</p>
<p>My search for this elusive piece led me to BlingCharming's website in early 2025. I wasn't just looking for a product; I was looking for an experience, a retailer that understood the passion behind unique finds. Iâ€™ve always valued businesses that treat customers with genuine care, the kind of service that builds lasting relationships, not just transactional exchanges. I remember reading a review that truly encapsulated the kind of dedication and personalized attention I hoped to encounter, an experience that transcended a simple purchase. It was about how a jeweler could make you feel, the knowledge they shared, and the friendships forged, and I knew that was the benchmark I was looking for in my search. This is what one customer shared about their experience, which set my expectations for service:</p>
<p>"TLDR - Go see Tony!</p>
<p>I think this review is long over due, so happy to share my thoughts on the awesome experiences I've had with Tony, Geoff, the team and Shreve &amp; Co as a whole!</p>
<p>I've always wanted a luxury watch, it started when my dad got his and it sparked a fascination that has lasted approximately fifteen years for me. When I was ready to buy a watch, I did a lot of research on where to buy what I wanted. Being in the bay area, there are several options for the brand that I wanted. I visited several of them, gauged their friendliness, willingness to help and overall responsiveness. In the end, I ultimately decided that I thought Shreve &amp; Co. would be the best fit for me.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>I never felt pressure to buy something I didn't want. Ever.</li>
<li>Every time I visited, I learned something new. I learned about brands I never knew about, I learned about stones I had never heard about and most importantly to me I learned a lot about watches.</li>
<li>I made great friends who I know are willing to take care of me and help me in answering my questions honestly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading through other people's reviews, I agree the wait for a watch is hard! I waited for many of the items that I eventually ended up purchasing and it can be painful! While instant gratification is great, I can tell you once you that the purchase after a long wait is even more amazing. In the grand scheme of things, if you've been waiting as long as I have an extra month or year only helps to build the anticipation.</p>
<p>Like many other people state on these reviews, many watches, specifically Rolex has a long wait list. Don't despair, enjoy the wait, make new friends, learn new things. If you're willing to go into their store, get to know their team, learn about the things you're passionate about and you will have a great time. I went in for watches, and what I've come away with is much much more. I've had several times where I went in just to ask questions and didn't end up buying anything and Tony showed me all the patience in the world.</p>
<p>To say the least, I've had nothing but amazing experiences. For all those who have made it this far in my review, I really do hope you go and have the same experience I've had because for me it has been awesome. Personally, I'd never recommend anything I wouldn't use or love, so I hope that comes across when I talk about how well I've been treated here.</p>
<p>For those of you who are getting ready to make your first purchase (watch or jewelry) one thing I'd share is a recent experience. After fifteen years of anticipation, approximately two years of talking and learning from Tony they helped make a dream come true. For a milestone birthday, they sent me a gift and I went in to go say thank you. As I was getting ready to leave after thanking them, they said they had "one more surprise." I was stunned, I really hadn't expected them to do what they did. In a moment it was just pure joy. All I can tell you is that I'm incredibly fortunate to be looked after by Tony, Geoff and the other members at Shreve &amp; Co and hope you have the same experience I've had."</p>
<p>Inspired by such high standards of customer service, I diligently explored BlingCharmingâ€™s offerings. Their website was a delight to navigate, showcasing a stunning array of unique pieces. Thatâ€™s when I stumbled upon the <a href="https://blingcharming.com/products/qiming-cletic-axes-necklace-women-shield-viking-cross-gladiator-medieval-pewter-pendant-gold-cross-necklace-men-jewelry?variant=39581727162420&source=n8n">Cletic Axes Necklace</a>. Its blend of Viking, Gladiator, and Medieval aesthetics immediately captivated me. The antique bronze plating promised a rugged, authentic look, perfectly aligning with my desire for a statement piece. The product description was detailed, leaving no room for doubt about its design and materials. The checkout process was smooth and straightforward, reinforcing my decision. I placed my order, my anticipation building with every passing hour until its expected arrival.</p>
<p>The wait for my <a href="https://blingcharming.com/products/qiming-cletic-axes-necklace-women-shield-viking-cross-gladiator-medieval-pewter-pendant-gold-cross-necklace-men-jewelry?variant=39581727162420&source=n8n">Cletic Axes Necklace</a> felt surprisingly short, and when the package arrived at my doorstep in mid-2025, I approached it with a delightful mix of excitement and curiosity. The packaging was simple yet secure, ensuring the pendant arrived in perfect condition. As I carefully unwrapped it, the rustic charm of the antique bronze finish immediately caught my eye. The shield design, adorned with axes and a cross, was even more intricate and detailed in person than it appeared on the screen. It had a substantial weight to it, a satisfying heft that spoke of quality and craftsmanship, not cheap flimsy metal. It wasn't just a piece of jewelry; it felt like a tangible artifact, precisely the kind of historical aura I had hoped for. The initial impression was overwhelmingly positive, exceeding my already high expectations.</p>
<p>Since then, the <a href="https://blingcharming.com/products/qiming-cletic-axes-necklace-women-shield-viking-cross-gladiator-medieval-pewter-pendant-gold-cross-necklace-men-jewelry?variant=39581727162420&source=n8n">Cletic Axes Necklace</a> has become an indispensable part of my daily wardrobe. I wear it to casual gatherings, work, and even when I simply want to feel a touch of ancient power. Itâ€™s incredibly versatile, pairing surprisingly well with everything from a simple t-shirt to a more structured blouse, adding an immediate touch of personality. The antique bronze plating has held up beautifully, maintaining its unique patina without any signs of wear or discoloration, even with frequent use. Iâ€™ve received countless compliments, with people often asking about its origin and the story behind its striking design. It feels comfortable against my skin, and the chain, while robust, doesnâ€™t snag or irritate. This necklace truly delivered on its promise to be a captivating and durable statement piece.</p>
<p>While my overall experience has been overwhelmingly positive, if I had to nitpick, I'd suggest perhaps offering a slightly longer chain option for those who prefer a lower drape, although the current length is perfectly fine for me. This is a minor preference rather than a true flaw. All in all, the <a href="https://blingcharming.com/products/qiming-cletic-axes-necklace-women-shield-viking-cross-gladiator-medieval-pewter-pendant-gold-cross-necklace-men-jewelry?variant=39581727162420&source=n8n">Cletic Axes Necklace</a> from BlingCharming has been an absolute triumph. Itâ€™s more than just an accessory; it's a conversation starter, a nod to history, and a piece that truly reflects my individuality. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for unique, high-quality jewelry that tells a story. If you appreciate Viking, medieval, or gladiator aesthetics and want a piece that combines strength with intricate design, this necklace is an absolute must-have. Itâ€™s certainly exceeded my expectations and brought a distinct charm to my collection.
